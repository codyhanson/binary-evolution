All signals are named in CamelCase
Signal format is <Type><Operation><Target>
where Type is something like Addr, Data, Sel and/or its origin module (like MemExStall)
and Operation is like "Read" or "Write"
and Target is like "MemEx"

The clock will be: clk
Reset will be synchronous and active high and called: rst

modules will be named in lowercase and verilog files are also lowercase. Ex- alu.v
testbenches will be of format t_module.v

Inputs and Outputs will be instantiated with 2001 conventions like: module DUT(.clk(clk), .rst(rst), .signal(anothername));

Inputs should be before output and clk and rst should be first. 
It doesn't matter whether multiple lines or one line is used.
